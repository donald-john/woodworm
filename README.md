Woodworm.js
========

### This project has been abandoned :{
### Instead, use these services which will do the trick just fine
1. Bible.org's html web API https://labs.bible.org/api_web_service
2. Logos' Reftagger plugin https://faithlife.com/products/reftagger
<br>
*If you'd like to build off of it, feel free to fork and start there!*

Woodworm.js is a javascript library to parse and display bible passages from labs.bible.org.
This is still under early development but a demo of what's done so far can be seen here:
[https://donald-john.github.com/woodworm](https://donald-john.github.com/woodworm)


#Usage

First, mark a div with any id you'd like.<br/>
`<div id="bible"></div>`

Then, call Woodworm.<br/>
`$('#bible').Woodworm()`

#Documentation

For now, while under development, documentation is being auto generated by [YUI](http://yui.github.io/yuidoc/). <br/>
The plugin page will be updated soon with the doc pages.

##Todo / Wishlist

1. Select Verses
2. Verse export (csv, plaintext, etc.)
3. Verse tagging / displaying
  1. Call WW on a block of text containing bible verses (eg. Deuteronomy 12:4) and WW highlights it and displays an overlay with the verse text from labs.bible.org. Onclick, navigate to Lumina.
