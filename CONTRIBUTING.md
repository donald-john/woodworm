# Contributing

I'm definitely open to help developing this plugin.
Check out the directions below on how to submit a pull request - I'll try to merge things in as often as I can while keeping the code clean. I'll also try and keep an updated wishlist as well so we'll have a bit of direction :)

1. Fork it!
2. Create your feature branch: `git checkout -b my-new-feature`
3. Make your changes on the `src` folder, never on the `dist` folder.
4. Commit your changes: `git commit -m 'Add some feature'`
5. Push to the branch: `git push origin my-new-feature`
6. Submit a pull request :D
